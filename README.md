# Rainbow Kahoot!
This is my first mobile app, made with expo
It's basically a cheat for kahoot, it allows you to see answers
You can search by quiz title, so you don't have to type the quizid anymore, just copy it in the browse tab and paste it in the QuizId tab :)
Production APK is available [here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/sj7w22sxicuekck/rainbow-kahoot-1.0.apk/file)
Every ideas/issue report/pull request is welcome !
Enjoy :)

## Get started

- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:
